  <p id="paraone">My name is Katherine Nugent and this is my first webpage outside of KhanAcademy. 
    I want to make sure I <i>retained</i> the information I have learned as well as put it 
    to use. Here is a basic list of the things I have learned.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>How to change the <i>font</i></li>
    <li id="listtwo">How to change text color</li>
    <li id="listthree">how to insert images and link images</p>

  alt = dog width=200></a>
  <li id="listfour">how to change font size</li>
  <li>how to insert <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com">links</a>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 id="headertwo">A brief paragraph of things I'm the most proud of</h2>
  
  <p id="parathree">This has been a <i>very</i> fun little hobby to pick up. Maybe if I continue 
  working on it, I could make it a full time thing. I enjoy the creativity that goes 
  along with it, as well as the organization. I'm very grateful for the internet
  offering so many resources to help me with this little project. I am most proud of figuring out internal 
  links, as well as linking images. I struggled during the course to wrap my head around it, 
  but I seem to have the hang of it. </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>this is pretty sick</li>
    <li><b>like you're creating something in an interesting way</b></i>
  <li>like I can just add in this picture of a cow what the fuck</li>

  <h2 id="conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
  
  <p id="parafour">This has been fantastic. It's a lot of fun and just the right amount of challenging.
